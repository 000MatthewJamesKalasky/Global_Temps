# Global Temperatures Project

Welcome to the Global Temperatures Project repository! This project is designed to analyze and visualize global temperature trends to enhance our understanding of climate change. Through meticulous data analysis and machine learning models, we aim to provide insights into how global temperatures have changed over time and predict future trends.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes historical temperature data to uncover patterns and trends in global temperatures. Our analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend visualization, and predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the temperature data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often with visual methods.
- **Trend Visualization:** Creating visual representations of global temperature trends over time.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Employing machine learning algorithms to predict future temperature trends based on historical data.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system, along with the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```
